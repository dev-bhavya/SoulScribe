# SoulScribe - Journaling App

---

## Overview

SoulScribe is a Java and Spring Boot based journaling application that allows users to write down their thoughts, feelings, experiences, and reflections. It provides a platform for users to engage in personal writing activities such as stream-of-consciousness entries, gratitude documentation, goal setting, or simply recording notable life events.
 
Users can register with unique usernames and passwords, create, edit, and delete journal entries, and update their credentials. 

The app employs MongoDB to securely store user data and journal entries, with passwords encrypted to ensure user credentials remain safe. Role-based authentication is implemented for both users and administrators.
